# TFS PR Templates

**This is now a built-in [Azure DevOps feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/pull-request-templates?view=vsts), so this extension won't be updated going forward.**

This extension allows you to define templates for your TFS pull requests and quickly apply those to the pull request description.

Example:
![Apply template](marketplace/pr-templates1.gif?raw=true)
